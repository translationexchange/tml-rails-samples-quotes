Sample Applications
==================

This sample application demonstrates some of Tml's capabilities


Installation
==================

To install the app, use:

```ssh
$ git clone https://github.com/translationexchange/tml-rails-samples-foody.git
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec rails s
```

Open your browser and point to:

http://localhost:3000


To be able to translate any elements in the application, you must be a registered user on TranslationExchange.

Once you register as a new user, add a new application and copy the token to the configuration file.

Open "config/initializers/tml.rb" and change the following lines:

```ruby
Tml.configure do |config|
  config.application = {
      key: "YOUR KEY",
      token: "YOUR TOKEN",
  }
end
```

This will allow you to add more languages, become app translator, and much more...
